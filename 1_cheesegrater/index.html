    Cheese Grater Reverse Engineering
</h1>

<!-- Overview -->
<div class="section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This project involves reverse-engineering a plastic kitchen cheese grater. 
        I worked with 8 components through disassembly, part measurement, sketching, 
        3D modeling, and final product assembly.

<!-- Objective -->
<div class="section">
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
        This project was completed as part of a class term assignment. 
        The goal was to develop familiarity with disassembly and reconstruction 
        of real-world objects to gain an understanding of their design features, 
        how components interact, and the underlying manufacturing considerations.
    </p>

<!-- Skills Used -->
<div class="section skills-list">
    <h2>Skills Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Precise measurement</li>
        <li>Advanced SolidWorks modeling (patterned extrusions, swept profiles, shelling, symmetric and asymmetric lofts)</li>
        <li>Assembly mates & exploded view animation</li>
        <li>Technical drawings & dimensioning</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Obstacles & Solutions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Obstacle:</strong> Obtaining accurate measurements due to the enclosed design of the product.  
            <br>
           <strong>Solution:</strong> Averaged multiple measurement samples and cross-referenced them with mated parts in the assembly.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Obstacle:</strong> Establishing core geometry for each part.  
            <br>
           <strong>Solution:</strong> Applied advanced modeling techniques and consulted the SolidWorks community for software troubleshooting.
        </li>
